# Pronunciation

You can pronounce the names of my projects any way you want. I don’t mind too much how things are pronounced. I know that SQL is supposed to be pronounced Sequel, but I would rather say S Q L, this shouldn’t be a problem. Feel free to pronounce my projects any way you want, and embrace your right to pronunciation across the digital world (not just my projects)
